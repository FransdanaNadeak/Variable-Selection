# Feature Selection Technique :
- EDA
- Correlation Matrix
- Pvalue (Linear Regression Model)
- Backward Elimination


1. Before modelling, we should define target variable and the feature. Target Varable would be 'Totalprice', while the features are all the variable except 'totalprice'

2. From the Data Exploration of Categorical Variabel that have been compared by Price, we can see that Variable Out and Street Category have no siginificant different each type when compared by price in the boxplot. So, we Drop Variable 'Out' and 'Street' from the Features
